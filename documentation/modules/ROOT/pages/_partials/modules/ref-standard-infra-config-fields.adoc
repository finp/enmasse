|Field |Description
|version |Specifies the {ProductName} version used. When upgrading, {ProductName} uses this field to determine whether to upgrade the infrastructure to the requested version.
|admin.resources.memory |Specifies the amount of memory allocated to the admin pod.
|admin.podTemplate.metadata.labels |Specifies the labels added to the admin pod.
|admin.podTemplate.spec.priorityClassName |Specifies the priority class to use for the admin pod so you can prioritize admin pods over other pods in the {KubePlatform} cluster.
|admin.podTemplate.spec.affinity |Specifies the affinity settings for the admin pod so you can specify where on particular nodes a pod runs, or if it cannot run together with other instances.
|admin.podTemplate.spec.tolerations |Specifies the toleration settings for the admin pod, which allow this pod to run on certain nodes on which other pods cannot run.
|broker.addressFullPolicy |Specifies action taken when a queue is full: `BLOCK`, `FAIL`, `PAGE`, `DROP`. The default value is `PAGE`. For more information see the link:{LinkaddressFullPolicyDocs}[{BrokerName} documentation^].
|broker.globalMaxSize |Specifies the maximum amount of memory used for queues in the broker.
|broker.resources.memory |Specifies the amount of memory allocated to the broker.
|broker.resources.storage |Specifies the amount of storage requested for the broker.
|broker.podTemplate.metadata.labels |Specifies the labels added to the broker pod.
|broker.podTemplate.spec.priorityClassName |Specifies the priority class to use for the broker pod so you can prioritize broker pods over other pods in the {KubePlatform} cluster.
|broker.podTemplate.spec.affinity |Specifies the affinity settings for the broker pod so you can specify where on particular nodes a pod runs, or if it cannot run together with other instances.
|broker.podTemplate.spec.tolerations |Specifies the toleration settings for the broker pod, which allow this pod to run on certain nodes on which other pods cannot run.
|broker.connectorIdleTimeout |Specifies the AMQP idle timeout to use for connection to router.
|broker.connectorWorkerThreads |Specifies the number of worker threads of the connection to the router.
|broker.storageClassName |Specifies what storage class to use for the persistent volume for the broker.
|broker.updatePersistentVolumeClaim |If the persistent volume supports resizing, setting this value to `true` allows the broker storage to be resized.
|router.resources.memory |Specifies the amount of memory allocated to the router.
|router.linkCapcity |Specifies the default number of credits issued on AMQP links for the router.
|router.handshakeTimeout |Specifies the amount of time in seconds to wait for the secure handshake to be initiated.
|router.minReplicas |Specifies the minimum number of router pods to run; a minimum of two are required for high availability (HA) configuration.
|router.podTemplate.metadata.labels |Specifies the labels added to the router pod.
|router.podTemplate.spec.priorityClassName |Specifies the priority class to use for the router pod so you can prioritize router pods over other pods in the {KubePlatform} cluster.
|router.podTemplate.spec.affinity |Specifies the affinity settings for the router pod so you can specify where on particular nodes a pod runs, or if it cannot run together with other instances.
|router.podTemplate.spec.tolerations |Specifies the toleration settings for the router pod, which allow this pod to run on certain nodes on which other pods cannot run.
|router.idleTimeout |Specifies the AMQP idle timeout to use for all router listeners.
|router.workerThreads |Specifies the number of worker threads to use for the router.
|router.policy.maxConnections |Specifies the maximum number of router connections allowed.
|router.policy.maxConnectionsPerUser |Specifies the maximum number of router connections allowed per user.
|router.policy.maxConnectionsPerHost |Specifies the maximum number of router connections allowed per host.
|router.policy.maxSessionsPerConnection |Specifies the maximum number of sessions allowed per router connection.
|router.policy.maxSendersPerConnection |Specifies the maximum number of senders allowed per router connection.
|router.policy.maxReceiversPerConnection |Specifies the maximum number of receivers allowed per router connection.
