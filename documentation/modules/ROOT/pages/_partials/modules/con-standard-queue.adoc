// !standard.address.queue.longDescription:start
The queue address type is a store-and-forward queue. This address type is appropriate for implementing a distributed work queue, handling traffic bursts, and other use cases where you want to decouple the producer and consumer. A queue can be sharded across multiple storage units. Message ordering might be lost for queues in the standard address space.
