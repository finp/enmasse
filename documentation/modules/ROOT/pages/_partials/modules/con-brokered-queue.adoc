// !brokered.address.queue.shortDescription:A store-and-forward queue
// !brokered.address.queue.longDescription:start
The queue address type is a store-and-forward queue. This address type is appropriate for
implementing a distributed work queue, handling traffic bursts, and other use cases where you want
to decouple the producer and consumer. A queue in the brokered address space supports selectors,
message groups, transactions, and other JMS features. Message order can be lost with released messages.
