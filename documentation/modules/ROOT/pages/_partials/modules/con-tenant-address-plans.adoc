= Address plans

An address is configured with an address plan, which describes the resource usage of that address.
The address plans are configured by the service administrator and can vary between {ProductName}
installations. The number of addresses that can be created, and what plans are available, depends on
quota enforced by the address space plan.

Some address types also support changing the `plan` field: `queue`, `anycast`, and `multicast`
address types in the `standard` address space support changing the plan as long as the new plan
does not exceed the allowed quota. For queues, addresses are dynamically migrated across brokers,
which might cause reordering of messages.
