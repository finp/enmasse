// !standard.address.subscription.longDescription:start
The subscription address type allows a subscription to be created for a topic that holds messages published to the topic even if the subscriber is not attached. The subscription is accessed by the consumer using <topic-address>::<subscription-address>. For example, for a subscription `mysub` on a topic `mytopic` the consumer consumes from the address `mytopic::mysub`.
